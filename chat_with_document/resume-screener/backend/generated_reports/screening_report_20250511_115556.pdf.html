            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Based on the candidate's resume, Dhiraj Sharma is a strong fit for the role, with robust technical skills in PySpark, Big Data, and Cloud Technologies. His extensive hands-on experience in creating scalable data pipelines and optimizing Spark jobs aligns well with the job requirements. However, the overall match score of 0.31 out of 1.0 suggests that there may be some gaps in his experience, particularly in Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) and Spark's Catalyst Optimizer, Dhiraj's strengths, but further evaluation is needed to confirm his fit for the role.</p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Here is a 3-5 sentence evaluation of the candidate's fit for the role:

The candidate, Vijay Jawali, demonstrates a good understanding of PySpark, particularly in integrations, which aligns with the job requirement. However, the candidate falls short in other key areas, such as experience in production tuning and deploying data pipelines, as well as proficiency in Cloudera Data Platform. The overall match score of 0.18 out of 1.0 indicates that the candidate only partially meets the job requirements, with areas for improvement. Despite this, the candidate can be pushed to the next stage, but will need to demonstrate significant growth in the subsequent rounds.</p>
